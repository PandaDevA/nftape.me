# NFTüçåAPE 

Welcome fellow Ape üëã

If you're reading this, you must be no stranger to NFTs. You might have even aped into a couple.

If so, you've come to the right place. NFTüçåAPE will scan your wallet's history and tell you how good of a JPEG flipper you are. Share with 1 click.

More specifically, you'll find out: 

- how much you've spent on NFTs
- how much you've earned from NFTs
- your Profit/Loss
- how much you've [paperhanded](https://mywallst.com/blog/what-does-paper-hands-mean/)**
- how much you're [diamondhanding](https://mywallst.com/blog/what-does-diamond-hands-mean/)***

** example: you sold your SMB at 30 SOL, thinking you've made a killer flip. It's now worth 500 SOL. You've "paperhanded" 470 SOL.

*** example: you bought a Boryoku Dragon at 10 SOL on one of the marketplaces. You're still holding it, and it's currently worth 1500 SOL. You're "diamondhanding" 1490 SOL.

## Is it free?

- 100% free
- 100% open source
- No need to connect your wallet (no security concerns), simply paste your address

## How it works?

Limitations
- doesn't look beyond 1 wallet
  - eg it has no idea what other wallets belong to you, so won't "aggregate" your NFTs
- ignores NFT transfers, and only monitors sales transactions on the supported marketplaces 
  - eg if you've sent the NFT away and then sold it on a marketplace using a different wallet - NFTüçåAPE won't know
  - eg if you sold the NFT OTC - NFTüçåAPE won't know
- currently Solana only
- currently 6 marketplaces only (MagicEden, SolanArt, DigitalEyes, Alpha Art, Exchange.Art, SolSea)
